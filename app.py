# Arrr matey! Gather 'round and listen to me tale!
# Here at the crow's nest o' our application, we be havin' our mighty Flask vessel initialized.
# What be this Flask ye ask? 'Tis a lightweight treasure chest o' web tools for our Python plunderin'!
# 
# The Flask app be the heart o' our vessel - without it, we'd be sinkin' to the depths!
# Typically ye'd see somethin' like: "app = Flask(__name__)" to christen our ship
# But the cap'n who came before us already did the deed, so we continue the voyage from here.
# 
# Remember, ye bilge rats, all routes an' configurations hang off this Flask app like barnacles!
# An' if ye touch this initialization incorrectly, the whole ship might sink to Davy Jones' locker!
# Flask app is already initialized at the top of the file
