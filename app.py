# This here be the spot where our mighty vessel, the Flask app, be set to sail!
# Aye, at this very point in our map, the Flask object be conjured and ready,
# like a fine ship waitin' to brave the treacherous seas of the world wide web!
# The cap'n (that be the developer, ye see) has already hoisted the mainsail
# by initializing our trusty Flask app right here at the crow's nest of our file.
# Shiver me timbers, it be a fine way to start our journey through these code waters!
# Flask app is already initialized at the top of the file
